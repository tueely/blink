Hardware Implementation of a Trashcan

TRASHCAN MOVEMENT IDEA: 
take a bucket and tape strings to both sides, have pulleys on both sides and then pull them on either side depending on where the projectile goes with reference to the trashcan itself

PLOT IDEA: 
I missed a shot at the trashcan.
Realized it was a skill issue.
Then remembered I study ECE at UofT.
So I coded a trashcan that never misses.

STACK IDEA: 
1. use python and openCV to break down a canvas into different layers and use the camera to identify which projectile is going to which layer and work on it with that
