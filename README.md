Hardware Implementation of an Automated Bucket Carrier

TRASHCAN MOVEMENT IDEA: 
take a shoebox and tape strings to both sides, have pulleys on both sides and then pull them on either side depending on where the projectile goes with reference to the trashcan itself

PLOT IDEA: 
I missed a shot at the trashcan.
Realized it was a skill issue.
Then remembered I study ECE at UofT.
So I coded a trashcan that never misses.
